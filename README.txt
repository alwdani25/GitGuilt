The idea for GitGuilt sparked as someone who loves starting new projects only to abandon them once a shinier, “more interesting” one comes along—or just when passion fizzles out. Will this be just another abandoned project, adding to the irony? Or will it finally be a complete project for once? Who knows. Either way, it’s here to gently poke you about your repos.
